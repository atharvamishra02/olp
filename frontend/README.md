sorry i can't deploy it because my laptop's battery is almost dead and i dont have electricity in my area.

so for project install nodemodules for both frontend and backend for ur computer

to start frontend - npm run dev
for backend - node server.js

1. User Interaction (Frontend â€“ React)
Users visit the web app and interact with different pages like:

Home

Login / Register

Course Details

Dashboards (Student/Admin)

They browse courses, log in, register, and enroll through a clean user interface built using React and styled with Tailwind CSS.

2. Sending API Requests (Frontend â†’ Backend)
All interactions that need data (like logging in or fetching courses) are done through Axios, which sends HTTP requests from the frontend to the backend.

This is managed via a central api.js file where Axios is configured. It knows the backend server URL using an environment variable so you can easily switch between development and production.

3. Handling Requests (Backend â€“ Node.js/Express)
When a request hits the backend, here's what happens:

Express routes handle the request.

Middleware checks for things like authentication (is the user logged in?) and authorization (is the user a student or admin?).

It then interacts with the MongoDB database using Mongoose models like User, Course, Lesson, etc.

Finally, it sends a response back to the frontend with the required data.

4. Authentication & Role Management
When users log in, they get a JWT (JSON Web Token).

This token is used in future requests to verify who they are.

Middleware like auth.js and roles.js checks these tokens to make sure only authorized users can access sensitive routes (e.g., students can't access admin features).

5. File Uploads
When admins or instructors upload media like images or videos for a course, those files are stored in the backendâ€™s uploads/ folder.

These files are then served when users view courses or lessons.

6. Frontend State & Display
Once the backend sends the data:

React updates the UI accordingly.

For example, a student dashboard may show enrolled courses and progress.

All state is managed inside React components or contexts.

ðŸ›  Backend (Node.js + Express)
Models (models/): Define database structure (User, Course, Lesson, etc.).

Routes (routes/): Handle different parts of the app:

auth.js: Login/register

admin.js: Admin actions

student.js: Student actions

public.js: Publicly available course info

Middleware (middleware/):

auth.js: Checks if a user is logged in

roles.js: Restricts actions based on user roles

Config (config/):

db.js: MongoDB connection

jwt.js: JWT utility functions

Uploads Folder (uploads/): Stores images/videos

Main Server (index.js): Starts the Express server
